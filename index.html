<h1>Obi's top 50 songs of 2022</h1>
<p>I think my top 4 songs are all lead singles so 2023 knew how to read me like a book. I also listened to way too much emo for my own good this year and it will most certainly be reflected in this list. I'm sorry in advance</p>



<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">50.) </h2>


<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">49.) Pupil Slicer - Departure in Solitude</h2>
<p>Genre: Metalcore/Post-Metal</p>
<p>I considered putting this at 50 but didn't want the first words on this list to be "Pupil Slicer." The band combines a lot </p>


<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">48.) Sunami - Ten Toes Down</h2>
<p>Genre: Hardcore</p>
<p>The hardcore band taking the world by storm and I didn't really get it, but this song hooked me into kinda getting it. The vocals are the abrasive mix between spoken word and a traditional scream or shot. Feels more refrained to add a snear. The instrumentation behind it is brutal and crushes the listener with a constant pounding </p>

<p>Genre: Mathcore</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">18.) Balance and Composure - Last To Know</h2>
<p>"Iâ€™ll be your little afterthought/Your escape" gets me going every time. I yearn to belt it out........ Everything hits like Balance and Composure never left the scene and culminates in a jam band deconstruction of the instruments with a droning bit of fleeting lyrics.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">9.) Invent Animate - Immolation of Night</h2>
<p>Genre: Metalcore</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1iwNEukbK48?si=PCFA7jzdJiIEvr_H" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Releasing a song in the year 2023 with the lyric "I am enough" is a cheat code. Invent Animate put out what may be their heaviest song, sonically, ever. It punches you in the gut in the first second and lets up only when it wants to build up to the next part. And you wouldn't believe it, but this song has my favorite breakdown of the year that gave me goosebumps while relistening to it before writing it. One thing I can't thank this song for enough is putting a refreshing twist of hopecore. The song feels very personalized and tackles personal growth and overcoming trauma (hence "I am enough"). That specific call to personal experiences gives a genuine feel to the words being spoken in the landscape where I've come to resent people putting on generic lyrics about getting better. </p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">8.) Topiary Creatures - Snake in the Walls</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H8AoWwNnJe0?si=TgFxck0QSXx34Hku" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Genre: Emo</p>
<p>I believe this was another suggestion on twitter. Before listening to the song, the band sounded like a group that musicians that grew into this sound which felt special. Since listening to their past catalog I know this isn't entirely true, but it feels like an emo band that got shoved through a 2012 metalcore filter. Though it doesn't feel stuck in either realm, the use of electronic elements, the higher register vocals, backing screams definitely feel foreign in the landscape I created in my head for 2020s emo. It makes the sound special and I can say this song is the best work they've put out now that I have taken a thorough deep dive into their catalog (I would also implore anyone who is a fan of this song to listen to September 9th, 2020 though). What really hooks me on this song are the backing screams, which are a nice touch when their adding to build up section, and then an incredibly catchy chorus. "Since when can I not talk to you" has polluted my brain ever since I first heard this. Despite this repetitive chorus, the guitars, drums, keys, samples, etc. never stay in the same spot for too long. It feels experimental while keeping some semblance of broader appeal. </p>


<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">6.) Trophy Eyes - Blue Eyed Boy</h2>
<p>Genre: Pop Punk</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QAn3qA5I6VE?si=S5pGSqHCsO2Em-jn" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>I sing this song in the same way the overly-quirky white girl from your hometown would rap the intro to the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.</p>


<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">5.) 100 Gecs - Dumbest Girl Alive</h2>
<p>Genre: Hyperpop</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oXrbMDww9ss?si=FEtD4fy3fLqwXZ_j" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>There was a part of me that genuinely thought this would be my most listened to song of the year. the THX intro in to a headbanging riff into some of the most eclectic and mesmorizing lyrics of the year. Might not be for everyone since 100 Gecs toned down the weirdness from their debut, what they're able to create even confined is an infectious song that is unique to them. The lyrics feel rooted to this central message while still featuring lines like "put emojis on my grave". All that aside, what puts this above mememe (my second favorite song from the album) and this song is this song keeps a constant groove that plays around in intensity to keep it interesting and lets me play on repeat with ease.</p>


<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">4.) Sydney Sprague - Smiley Face </h2>
<p>Alternative Rock</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MoJj9V3qK7Y?si=vz2MSsEpjaEN9FMa" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>In July I went to a Pool Kids concert knowing no one on the bill besides Pool Kids and holy fucking balls I did not expect anyone to steal the show form them. Everything this group did was incredible and all I could do was pray I remembered lyrics or they were on a setlist website for me to look up when I got home. Neither happened so I just listened through their whole catalog. I got to this song and played it on loop about 17 times. It's poppy and moody and cheery and dancy and everything under the sun. The chorus, "And I smile in my sleep/ It's the only time I get what I need/ I love that for me," is filled with sass and epitomizes the vibe of the album where it's being complacent with a mundane/shitty life. No stacks. No hoes. No nothing, I love that for me. In <a href="https://whenthehornblows.com/content/2023/9/17/artist-of-the-week-250-sydney-sprague">this interview</a>, she talks about how a big influence on the album was The Front Bottoms, and I could immediately hear Brian singing over this, despite Syndey and Brian sounding nothing alike sonically. This is the track that caught me off guard the most in 2023 I think. Go see live music.</p>


<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">3.) Silent Planet - Antimatter</h2>
<p>Genre: Alternative Metal/Metalcore</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wiEno0KE5uU?si=2e4_Mj7x_UWLn5LJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Wow that's crazy wowow obi has Silent Planet really high on a year end list wow. On a serious note, this song and album do a flawless transition from the citation-neededcore to creating a more personal narrative in a song, as this discusses the moments after their van flipped on tour. Put most bluntly in the line "Bodies lay like shattered glass" creates a great visual as the lyrics throughout the rest of the song reference various configurations of light. From the northern lights to the neon street signs. Every memory littered with these visuals as the accident tries to steal these shared experiences. The second verse puts it beautifully with "We're waiting in the wreckage for the sun to rise/ I'm staring at the fractures no one else can see, they're so complete/ When morning comes, will there be anyone left to find?/ My vision starts to surrender, as colors subvert the night." Here the lyrics dance between variations of light in the space of time as the idea of the sunlight coming from the dawn parallels the light at the end of the tunnel in death. I spend all this time on the lyrics to mention they're not my favorite part of the song. My favorite part was alluded to with the earlier single :Signal: which is a massive ramp up in samples being used in Silent Planet songs. The groove in this 
 song is infectious and plays really well with the intermittent guitar chugs. Not to be stuck in djent jail, the bridge features soaring guitars that separate the part into it's own unique feature. Also while he doesn't get a highlight in the song, I'd be remisced to not call out ina Silent Planet review how Alex holds it down on drums every song.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">2.) Dying Wish - Torn From Your Silhouette</h2>
<p>Genre: Metalcore</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffLw_S9MrhA?si=aiR-gndy-GWqNro3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Dying Wish has created a perfect concoction of blending elements of metal with hardcore roots. Hey metalcore, that thing I've been addicted to since I was 15. In the middle of their sophomore album, Symptoms of Survival, lies this anthemic track. The song features a conventional structure, with nonconventional pacing. The vocalist, Emma switches between harsh and clean vocals effortlessly midverse as the band switches between blistering riffs and melodic highs. I don't think I could ever speak highly enough about how well the clean vocals come across in this song. They just soar and soar and soar over whatever the band throws at her. As with every metalcore song, there is a breakdown that plays about two-thirds of the way through. Each band member finds a way to play with the build up before hitting as low as they can on the follow through. It's brooding and malicious. The lyrics at the build up call back to an earlier part of the song with "My weakness is you/ Parasite/ bleed me dry"  and are followed up by dual vocal lows over the breakdown which go crazy.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">1.) Home is Where - yes! yes! a thousand times yes </h2>
<p>Genre: Emo</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXGOwsz85Sg?si=HkOSkb7XXGz8F3NT" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>In late 2022, I caught myself slipping into scene twitter. Through a series of bands recommending bands recommending bands, I came across Home is Where's 2021 album, I Became Birds. For a few months I was captivated by the bands crackling emo groove with mixes of of what felt like a hint of southern blues. At least that's what my dumbass brain thinks when I hear a harmonica in a song that also has a guitar. Anyways, there I am, captivated as one is, and then they drop their lead single for their upcoming album, The Whaler. If you know me, I fucking love whales. So I want to hear an emo band talk about whales. Instead, the lead single gave me a 220 second dowsing a couple faking love for the sake of normalcy (paraphrasing from a <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2221441/home-is-where-yes-yes-a-thousand-times-yes/music/">stereogum article about the release</a>). The song begins with an infectious riff that kicks back in a second time with the drums. The third trip around we get "Her wedding dress was sewn/ From semen she spat into/ Her hands, screaming/ I do, I do!" This is some of my favorite imagery I've heard in lyrics in a long itme. It screams of a vapid love in a way no one but Home is Where would write, crass and out of left field. the meter of the line dances in rhythm with the riff. The song continues a second verse mirroring the first, the riff remaining the back bone for about half before breaking off for a heavier riff as the song elevates. This corresponds with the wedding of the two characters. As the ceremony dies down we get the riff sneaking back in with a "Squishing mosquitoes/ All along their arms/ Then drove on home/ In separate cars" a somber ending where we tie back into this fake love motif. Pretty remiscent of Foxing song The Medic, although Home is Where throws conventional song structure out the window and lets the verses and narrative speak for itself.</p>
